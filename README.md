# Features

 1. Lighting:
 • Two types of lighting are implemented for a realistic effect:
 • Point Light: For focused illumination of specific areas.
 • Ambient Light: For general lighting across the scene.
 2. 3D Shapes:
 • Utilized Triangle Mesh to build the 3D shapes.
 • Incorporated basic geometric shapes such as:
 • Circle.
 • Square.
 3. Materials:
 • Applied Phong Material for realistic shading and lighting effects.
 4. Sound Effects:
 • Integrated dynamic sounds in the scenes using JavaFX MediaPlayer.
